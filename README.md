# 👋 Hi, I'm Patricio Pittana

**Frontend Engineer (React/TypeScript)** focused on building clean, scalable UI architectures.  
I design reusable component systems, predictable state flows, and frontend solutions aligned with real business workflows.  
I support my work with light backend using **Node.js/Express** when needed (auth, APIs, integrations).

I’ve built operational tools for **logistics**, **e-commerce**, and **small business workflows**, both web and desktop (Electron).
